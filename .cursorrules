# AI Agent Instructions for Portfolio Website

## Automatic Changelog Updates

**IMPORTANT**: Whenever you make changes to this codebase, you MUST update the changelog in `Website.code/src/data/updatesData.js`.

### How to Update the Changelog

1. **Location**: `/mnt/2TB/Website/Portfolio-Website/Website.code/src/data/updatesData.js`
2. **Format**: Add new entries at the TOP of the `updatesData` array
3. **Date Format**: DD/MM/YY (e.g., '12/01/26')

### Entry Format

For a single update:
```javascript
{
  date: 'DD/MM/YY',
  items: [
    'Description of what was changed'
  ]
},
```

For multiple related updates with a title:
```javascript
{
  date: 'DD/MM/YY',
  title: 'Title of Update',
  items: [
    'First change',
    'Second change',
    'Third change'
  ]
},
```

### Rules

1. **Always update** when making code changes (except for trivial fixes like typos in comments)
2. **Be descriptive** - explain what was changed and why
3. **Use proper grammar** and complete sentences
4. **Group related changes** under a single date entry with a title
5. **Escape single quotes** in descriptions using `\'`
6. **Insert at the top** of the updates array, right after `const updates = [`

### Example Workflow

When you make changes:
1. Complete your code changes
2. Open `Website.code/src/data/updatesData.js`
3. Add a new entry at the top of the updatesData array with today's date
4. Describe what you changed in clear, user-friendly language
5. Include the changelog update in the same commit as your changes

## Deployment
