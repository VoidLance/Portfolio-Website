## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Never Assume Cache Issues

**IT IS NEVER A CACHE ISSUE.** The developer always hard refreshes after every change and often works on a dev server with automatic hot-reload. If changes aren't appearing, the problem is in the code - look for typos, incorrect paths, JavaScript errors, CSS specificity issues, or logic errors. DO NOT suggest clearing cache, hard refresh, or restarting servers.

## Automatic Changelog Updates

**IMPORTANT**: Whenever you make changes to this codebase, you MUST update the changelog in `Website.code/src/data/updatesData.js`.

### How to Update the Changelog

1. **Location**: `/mnt/2TB/Website/Portfolio-Website/Website.code/src/data/updatesData.js`
2. **Format**: Add new entries at the TOP of the `updatesData` array
3. **Date Format**: DD/MM/YY (e.g., '12/01/26')

### Entry Format

For a single update:
```javascript
{
  date: 'DD/MM/YY',
  items: [
    'Description of what was changed'
  ]
},
```

For multiple related updates with a title:
```javascript
{
  date: 'DD/MM/YY',
  title: 'Title of Update',
  items: [
    'First change',
    'Second change',
    'Third change'
  ]
},
```

### Rules

1. **Always update** when making code changes (except for trivial fixes like typos in comments)
2. **Be descriptive** - explain what was changed and why
3. **Use proper grammar** and complete sentences
4. **Group related changes** under a single date entry with a title
5. **Escape single quotes** in descriptions using `\'`
6. **Insert at the top** of the updates array, right after `const updates = [`

### Writing Style Guidelines

**BE CONCISE AND IMPACTFUL** - The updates should be engaging, not verbose or AI-like.

- **Focus on intention and outcomes** over specific implementation details
- **Consolidate related changes** into single impactful statements (e.g., 7 helpdesk entries → 1 comprehensive entry)
- **Highlight impressive achievements** that would stand out to employers (e.g., performance improvements, full-stack capabilities, modern architecture)
- **Remove excessive technical specifics** (config file names, exact property changes, etc.)
- **Keep authentic human moments** (learning experiences, challenges overcome)
- **Use metrics when impressive** ("3 min → 30 sec deployment", "mobile-first responsive design")
- **Sound natural** - avoid phrases like "implemented comprehensive", "enhanced functionality", "optimized performance" unless they tell a real story

Good examples:
- "Built custom ticket management system with Supabase backend, real-time email notifications, and Kanban-style admin dashboard"
- "Engineered picture-in-picture modal system for blog posts with custom animations and blur effects"
- "Created animated gradient background with scroll-based color transitions"

Bad examples (too verbose/technical):
- "Updated Edge Function to send emails from helpdesk@alistairsweeting.online with Gmail as reply-to"
- "Removed post-insert row selection in Helpdesk form to avoid requiring anon SELECT policy"
- "Added comprehensive responsive text sizes across all pages using sm: and md: breakpoints"

### Example Workflow

When you make changes:
1. Complete your code changes
2. Open `Website.code/src/data/updatesData.js`
3. Add a new entry at the top of the updatesData array with today's date
4. Describe what you changed in clear, user-friendly language
5. Include the changelog update in the same commit as your changes

## Deployment

The site auto-deploys to Neocities when the user pushes to GitHub via a pre-push hook.
- Pre-push hook: builds with `npm run build` and uploads with `neocities push dist`
- No need to manually deploy or build during development
