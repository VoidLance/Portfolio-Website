# CRITICAL: Read This First

This file serves as a checkpoint to ensure AI agents see important project instructions.

**READ .cursorrules BEFORE PROCEEDING WITH ANY WORK**

The `.cursorrules` file contains:
- Mandatory changelog update requirements
- Code style guidelines  
- Project conventions
- Development procedures

This file is auto-read by Cursor IDE and some AI tools, but to ensure compliance:
1. Claude/GitHub Copilot users should manually read `.cursorrules`
2. Include `.cursorrules` in initial workspace context
3. Reference this file in project documentation

Location: `/.cursorrules` (at repository root)
