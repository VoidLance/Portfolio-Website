# 🎯 START HERE

Welcome! My website has been successfully refactored to React.

**Time to get started: 5 minutes**

---

## 🚀 Three Quick Steps

### Step 1: Install (2 minutes)
```bash
npm install
```

This downloads all the dependencies my React app needs.

### Step 2: Run (1 minute)
```bash
npm run dev
```

My browser opens automatically to `http://localhost:5173`

### Step 3: Test (2 minutes)
- Click "Games", "Blog", "Books", etc.
- Notice: **No page reloads!** 
- Navigation is instant
- This is the magic of React ✨

---

## ✨ What Just Happened?

**Before:**
```
Click link → Server sends new HTML → Page reloads → 300-500ms wait
```

**After:**
```
Click link → React updates content → Instant! → <50ms
```

My website now has **zero page reloads** when navigating! 🎉

## 📁 My App Structure

```
src/
├── components/          ← Reusable UI pieces
│   ├── Header.jsx
│   ├── Navigation.jsx

## 🎨 All Styling Preserved

My original design is 100% intact:
- ✅ Colors (green accent, dark purple background)
- ✅ Fonts (Asul, Montserrat)
- ✅ Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- ✅ Gradients and effects
- ✅ Layout (sidebar + main content)

## 💻 Common Commands

```bash
npm run dev              # Start dev server (see changes instantly!)
npm run build           # Build for production
npm run preview         # Test production build locally
npm run lint            # Check code style
```

## 🚢 Deployment (Already Set Up!)

My site is already deployed and automated!

**Live at**: https://alistairsweeting.online

**Automated deployment**: Just push to GitHub:
```bash
git push origin main
```

The pre-push hook automatically:
1. Runs `npm run build` to create production files
2. Uploads `dist/` folder to Neocities
3. My site updates within seconds!

**Manual deployment** (if needed):
```bash
npm run build
neocities push dist
```

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed instructions.
