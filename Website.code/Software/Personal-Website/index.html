        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Alistair, a new software developer with a lot of varied experience, including creative writing, game design, 3d modelling, IT support, bar work and teaching. I love creating web applications and learning new technologies, and I have recently started a Software Development training course that promises to get me a job once I've finished the course, so I'm currently extremely excited about it. This website is just a local portfolio (although this one is actually hosted on the same domain as my main portfolio) made for the course, so while it will improve with time as I progress through the course, my real portfolio website will always be <a href="https://alistairsweeting.online" target="_blank">here</a></p>
        <p>
            I have made the text on this page extremely, exceedingly large for now, because the links at the top go to the sections rather than other pages, and I don't have a lot of content to add yet, so I want to make sure that when you click the links, you can see that you've actually gone to a different section. This will be fixed in the future when I have more content to add.
        </p>
        <p>Text is not so large now, used css to make it scroll better. Also, as this website is hosted on GitHub, <a href="https://github.com/VoidLance/Course-Files/blob/main/Project%20Files/Personal%20Website/Index.html">this link here</a> should now link to the page on github. I really wish it would actually display the site instead of raw html, but I don't want to figure out github pages at the moment and I'm not even sure if it would work. I know for sure it would add more pages I don't really want to add.</p>

    <section id="projects">
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>I'm sure this section will be populated with something great in short time, but for now, I'm leaving it with placeholder text as I don't want to put outside projects into this one.</p><br><hr><br>
