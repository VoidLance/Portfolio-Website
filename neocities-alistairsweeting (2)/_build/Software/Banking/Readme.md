### Banking Application Example in JavaScript
This javascript app was created for an activity in the software development course I'm on.

#### Where to find the hosted version
Since part of the instructions for the activity was to host it on a web server, I have uploaded it to the Software section of my personal website. It can be accessed at: [https://alistairsweeting.online/Software/Banking/html/] and only via direct link for the moment. I am unsure whether I want to add a navbar link at this time.
